### Pre-trial decisions

- Expanded sodium chloride range to improve trend resolution across ionic strength
- Delivery rate near one drop per second to balance mixing stability and throughput
- Finer delivered-volume increments near equivalence to improve endpoint localization

### Controlled-variable enforcement

| Controlled variable | Intended control | How enforced in analysis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acid and base concentration | Fixed preparation targets | Centralized constants and run-consistency checks |
| Temperature | Target around 26 C | QC band checks and condition-level temperature diagnostics |
| Measurement sequence | Consistent titration progression | Step aggregation and derivative QC |
| Data columns and units | Standardized headers and units | Raw-to-standardized preprocessing |
